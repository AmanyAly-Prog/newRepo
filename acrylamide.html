    <h2>What is acrylamide?</h2>
  <p> Acrylamide is a natural chemical that is formed when starchy foods such as bread and potatoes are cooked for long periods at a high temperature. When these foods are cooked (fried, baked, roasted, toasted or grilled) to above 120°C (250°F), they naturally form acrylamide. Acrylamide is produced as part of the cooking process and improves the texture and taste of foods. Although it is a naturally occurring chemical that has always been present in food, there have been recent concerns that increased exposure can cause adverse effects to health.

  <h2>Which foods contain acrylamide?</h2>
<p>Carbohydrate-rich foods such as bread, roasted coffee beans, cooked potato products such as chips, crisps and roasted potatoes and some cereal and wheat products have the highest content of acrylamide. Processed foods such as biscuits and crackers also contain some. Boiling, steaming or microwaving are better cooking methods than grilling, roasting, toasting, frying or baking.
The Food Standards Agency are currently recommending the following steps to lower exposure:
<ul>
 <li> Avoid overcook starchy foods</li>
 <li>Consider duration and temperature of cooking</li>
 <li>‘Go for Gold’ – lightly toast or until the food is yellow rather than burn or cook to high temperatures for long periods of time</li>
 <li>Vary the diet to include a range of alternative starchy carbohydrate foods such as rice and pasta and a wide range of fruit and vegetables</li>
 <li>Read cooking instructions carefully and follow cooking times accordingly</li>
 <li>Avoid storing raw potatoes in the fridge. Refrigeration increases the level of free sugars in the potato and this in turns increases the amount of the precursor to acrylamide. Instead store them in the dark and if they are in the fridge, take them out and let them come to room temperature before cooking.</li></p>
